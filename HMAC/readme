#USAGE:
	To calculate the hmac of your files, just chose drag and drop your file int the Calculate-HMAC/Calculate folder, than
get your file, key,iv and respective hmac from the Calculate-HMAC/Calculated folder.
	To verify a hmac, just drag and drop the file, the hmac of the same file, the key and the iv into the
Verify-HMAC/Verify folder. If the hmac is valid, all files will be moved to HMAC-Valit, if not, they will be sent to
HMAC-Not-Valid.


#CAUTION!
	
	To prevent bugs, DO NOT check the calculate or verify more than one hmac at the same time.

	The key needs to be provided in hex base called as "key-file.txt"

	The iv needs to be provided in hex base called as "iv-file.txt" 

	The hmc to verify needs to be provided called as "MacToCheck.mac"

	key length> 128 bits

	iv length > 128 bits
