"Apocrypha, where all forbidden knowledge can be found. An endless
 library, with shelves stretching onward in all directions, stacks
 on top of stacks.Every book has a black cover with no title. Masses
 of ghosts movethrough the stacks, rifling through books, eternally
 searching for the knowledge they sought whilst living."
