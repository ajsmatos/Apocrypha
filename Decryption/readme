#USAGE:
	To decrypt your files, just chose one of the algorithms available (aes-128-cbc, aes-256-cbc, des and des3),
drag and drop your cryptogram, key, iv, into the respective folder, and get your decrypted file, previous key and iv
from the Decrypted Folder.
	
#CAUTION!
	
	To prevent bugs, DO NOT decrypt more than one file at the same time in the same folder.
	
	The key needs to be provided in hex base called as "key-file.txt"

	The iv needs to be provided in hex base called as "iv-file.txt"

	key lengths:
	
	aes-128-cbc > 128 bits
	aes-256-cbc > 256 bits
	des         > 56 bits
	des3        > 168 bits

	iv lengths:

	aes-128-cbc > 128 bits
	aes-256-cbc > 128 bits
	des         > 64 bits
	des3        > 64 bits
