#USAGE:
	To Check the integrity of your files, just chose one of the algorithms available (md5, sha1),
drag and drop your file and the hash to check to the respective folder. If the Integrity is valid,
the files are moved to Int-Valid folder, if not they are moved to Int-Not-Valid folder.

#CAUTION!
	
	To prevent bugs, DO NOT check the integrity of more than one file at the same time.

	The hashes provided need to be correctly called "HashToCheck.sha1" or "HashToCheck.md5"
	,depending on what kind of integrity verification you choosed.
